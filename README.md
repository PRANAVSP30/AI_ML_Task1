# AI & ML Internship — Task 1
## Understanding Dataset & Data Types
## Submitted by: Pranav S P


## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on understanding data structure, data types, and ML readiness using the Titanic Dataset.

It includes a modular Python codebase, a clean notebook, and a professional analysis report.

The goal was not to build a model, but to:

      Explore the dataset
      Identify feature types
      Check data quality
      Understand missing values
      Evaluate dataset suitability for ML

##  Interview Questions & Answers 
Here i am answering based om what i understand from the above task


### 1️. What is the difference between Numerical and Categorical data?

**Numerical Data**  
- Contains numbers  
- Used for mathematical operations  
- Examples: Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch  
- Used directly in ML after scaling  

**Categorical Data**  
- Contains labels/text  
- Cannot be used for math  
- Examples: Sex, Embarked, Cabin, Ticket  
- Must be encoded before ML  

**In my project:**  
I used my custom 'classify_features()' function to automatically identify them.



### 2️. What is a Target Variable?

The target variable is what the ML model predicts.

**In the Titanic dataset:**  
'Survived' is the target variable (0 = died, 1 = survived).

I identified it clearly in my analysis notebook.



### 3️. Why is Understanding the Dataset Important before Modeling?

Because it helps identify:  
- Missing values  
- Data types  
- Distribution  
- Imbalance  
- Preprocessing requirements  

**In my project:**  
'dataset_summary(df)' helped me understand shape, null values, unique values, and data types.



### 4️. What is Data Imbalance?

When one class has many more samples than another.

**Example:**  
In Titanic dataset:  
- More passengers died than survived  
- More males than females  

This can cause biased models.

I analyzed imbalance using 'value_counts()'.



### 5️. What does df.describe() show?

Statistical summary:  
- Mean  
- Std deviation  
- Min/max  
- Percentiles  

Helps detect:  
- Outliers  
- Distribution  
- Missing patterns  

**In my project:**  
I used it to analyze Fare and Age distributions.
